# Rx Rx

`@happypath/rx-rx` contains utility functions that we use for Angular and RxJs.

## Features

- [`@Observe`](docs/observe.md) - A decorator that creates an observable for you based on a class property.
- [`@AutoUnsubscribe` and `@Subscribes`](docs/auto-unsubscribe.md) - A pair of decorators that automatically unsubscribes from observables when a component is destroyed.
